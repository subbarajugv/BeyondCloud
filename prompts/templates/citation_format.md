## Inline Citations
Use bracketed numbers: [1], [2], etc.

## Source List Format
At the end of responses, list sources:

**Sources:**
1. [Document Title](file:///path/to/doc) - Relevant section
2. [Another Document](file:///path/to/other) - Page 5

## When Multiple Sources Agree

## When Sources Conflict

## No Source Found
